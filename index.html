          <p>We are a small established “SMART” service provider registered in Kenya and based on Lamu Island. Our MISSION is to encourage responsible tourism and promote more awareness about the island while working with the local business community in adding value to their services.
Our business model is based on collaborative efforts with Lamu’s local business community. We work with individual business owners to add value to their current services as we improve the quality, efficiency and hospitality of Lamu’s tourism sector. Our primary goal is to see tourists and community residents share information so that we can all better help each other preserve Lamu’s unique culture and natural environment. This can pave way for economic growth, unity, freedom, equality and basic rights for all people.
Standardized Services
One of the problems facing Lamu tourism today is the fact that tourists end up paying different rates for the same services. One way in which we are attempting to address this is by standardizing the tourism services provided by Lamu local business community.
Personalized Experiences
Another problem facing Lamu tourism is that tourists are only able to pre-book accommodation but not other activities. By selling packages we remove the burden of organizing activities while on holiday as well as ensuring that multiple businesses benefit from each visit. We have packages for couples, honeymooners, groups studying tourism and hotel management. Packages can be customized for families and single travelers on request. Our packages allow tourists to experience the Swahili culture and language and are suitable for both domestic and international market.
